As a template project, it is not meant to be a complete or fully-functional operating system, but rather a starting point for building your own OS. However, contributions to improve the template, fix bugs, or add new features are always welcome!

To contribute, please follow these steps:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch with a descriptive name.
- Make your changes and ensure they pass all tests.
- Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
- Push your changes to your fork.

Submit a pull request to the main repository. We appreciate all contributions, and will review pull requests as quickly as possible. However, please note that we are a small team and may not be able to address every issue immediately. If you would like to discuss a potential contribution before starting work, please open an issue and we'll be happy to chat with you!
